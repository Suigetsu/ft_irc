## What is IRC?
IRC, short for Internet Relay Chat, is a text-based chat protocol that allows clients to communecate with other clients (or servers) over. IRC users connect to one of numerous networks and then join one or more of the channels.
### IRC CLIENT AND SERVER
- Servers:
  > a point to which clients may connect and talk to each other, and a point for other servers to connect to, forming an IRC network. [Read more](https://modern.ircdocs.horse/#servers)
- Client: Anything connecting to a server that is not another server.
